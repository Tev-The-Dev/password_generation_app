This project is a revamp of the simple console password generator I did a while back.
In this one, it uses tkinter to create GUI to enable the user to type in the website ,username/email and password they are using to sign up.
There is an option to have the program generate a password that gets a random amount of letters (10-12), a random amount of number (2-4) and a random amount of symbols (2-4)
it will then shuffle the generated password and attempt to save the data in a .txt file named _my_user_data.txt in the users Documents instead of the projects folder.
The program will also copy the password to the clipboard so that the user can immediatly use the password without manually highlighting and copying the password.

I found this useful for me because many sites are requiring varying length of passwords that are very secure. Because it saves it in a document on the users computer, it is securely stored, as long as no one else has access to the computer.
